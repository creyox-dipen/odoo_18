    The Stripe Payment Extension for Odoo enables businesses to accept online card payments directly from backend invoices. A secure “Pay with Stripe” button appears on the invoice form view only for authorized users, allowing them to process payments with Visa, MasterCard, and other major cards via Stripe’s checkout page. Unlike Odoo’s default website payment option, this module is designed specifically for invoice payments from the Odoo backend, making it ideal for internal teams and accounting users.

    The module automates payment tracking and status updates, improving cash flow and reducing delays. By restricting payment access to designated users, it ensures security while providing a seamless, professional backend invoice payment experience for customers.
